    Summer is a time for adventure, and this year was no exception. I had many
    exciting experiences, but two of my favorites were my trip to the beach and my
    week at summer camp.

    At the beach, I spent my days swimming, collecting shells, and building
    sandcastles. I also went on a boat ride and saw dolphins swimming alongside
    us.
